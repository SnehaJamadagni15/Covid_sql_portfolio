# Covid Data Exploration SQL queries

##  Project Overview

This project explores global COVID-19 trends using SQL in PostgreSQL. I combined case and vaccination data to answer key questions like:

- Which countries had the highest infection and death rates?
- What percentage of a countryâ€™s population was vaccinated over time?
- How many new cases or deaths occurred daily?

The queries include window functions, CTEs, temporary tables and views to efficiently summarize and visualize the data.
